		<b>Description</b><br>
		Welcome to MASTERKEY, a multiplayer game where you need to<br>
		type in order to play. From accessing settings and menus to<br>
		playing the very game itself, your keyboard is your closest<br>
		ally.<br>
		<br>
		Speed and precision is key. There is no room for mistakes.<br>
		<br>
		This project was made for my final semester and is now<br>
		abandoned. You can find the game <a href = "https://the-l3rna3an.itch.io/masterkey">here</a>.
